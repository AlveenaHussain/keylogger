# KEYLOGGER

A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device that is designed to record and log every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. Keyloggers are often used for monitoring purposes, both legitimate (such as parental control or employee monitoring) and malicious (such as stealing passwords or sensitive information).

Keyloggers can capture:

1. Keystrokes: Every key pressed on the keyboard.
2. Screenshots: Periodically take screenshots of the user's screen.
3. Clipboard: Capture text copied to the clipboard.
4. Website URLs: Record websites visited by the user.
5. Application Usage: Log which applications are used and when.

Keyloggers can be installed intentionally by a user who wants to monitor activity on their own device or unintentionally through malware infections. They are a significant privacy concern because they can capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages.

Defending against keyloggers typically involves using antivirus software to detect and remove malicious software, being cautious of the software and links you click on, and using virtual keyboards for entering sensitive information when possible.
